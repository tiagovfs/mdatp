Offboard a device

Download the following offboarding configuration package available for a range of deployment tools.

Select the one relevant for your organization and follow the instructions.
See Configure devices section in the Microsoft Defender ATP guide for further instructions on how to offboard devices.

For security reasons, the offboarding package will expire within 30 days of its creation. The expiry date is embedded in the created package name: WindowsDefenderATPOffboardingPackage_valid_until_YYYY-MM-DD.zip (where YYYY-MM-DD is the expiry date of the package).

Expired offboarding packages sent to a device will fail to offboard the device.
